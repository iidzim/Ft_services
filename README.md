Ft_services will introduce you to Kubernetes. You will discover cluster management and
deployment with Kubernetes. You will virtualize a network and do "clustering".

The project consists of setting up an infrastructure of different services. To do this, you
must use Kubernetes. You will need to set up a multi-service cluster.
Each service will have to run in a dedicated container.
Each container must bear the same name as the service concerned and for performance
reasons, containers have to be build using Alpine Linux.
Also, they will need to have a Dockerfile written by you which is called in the setup.sh.
You will have to build yourself the images that you will use. It is forbidden to take
already build images or use services like DockerHub.
